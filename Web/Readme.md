# Web Penetration Testing (Pentesting) 
is a crucial activity to ensure the security of web applications. Pentesting simulates targeted attacks to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attackers. In this article, we will explore a wide range of common attacks, analysing how they work and how they can be mitigated. Each attack will be covered on both a theoretical and technical level, providing an in-depth understanding of its implications.

# Attacks that will be covered include:

SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Directory Traversal
File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)
