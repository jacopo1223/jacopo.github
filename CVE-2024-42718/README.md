# Proof of Concept: Path Traversal

# Application: Croogo 4.0.7

# Vulnerability Type
**POST-AUTH** Path Traversal This vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated in order to exploit it.

# Vulnerability Description. 
The Path Traversal vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the path parameter in the file manager endpoint. This allows arbitrary files to be read outside of the web root directory, such as /etc/passwd. 

# Steps taken:

I was able to log in to the application using the default **croogo/croogo** credentials.

Next, I navigated to a page that contained a file manager, through which it was possible to edit the files present.

I noted with interest that, using this feature, it was possible not only to edit files, but also to view certain directories on the system. !![Step 3 Screenshot](https://github.com/jacopo1223/jacopo.github/blob/main/CVE-2024-42718/step%203.png?raw=true)


After several attempts, I blocked a request using Burp Suite and made a change and was able to gain access to the /etc/passwd file. !![Descrizione dell'immagine](https://github.com/jacopo1223/jacopo.github/blob/main/CVE-2024-42718/photo_5836678526416307049_y.jpg?raw=true)
