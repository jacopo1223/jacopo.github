#Proof of Concept: Path Traversal

#Application: Croogo 4.0.7

Vulnerability Type: POST-AUTH Path Traversal This vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated in order to exploit it.

Vulnerability Description. The Path Traversal vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the path parameter in the file manager endpoint. This allows arbitrary files to be read outside of the web root directory, such as /etc/passwd. Steps taken:

I was able to log in to the application using the default croogo/croogo credentials. ![Image related to login].

Next, I navigated to a page that contained a file manager, through which it was possible to edit the files present. ![Image related to file manager page]

I noted with interest that, using this feature, it was possible not only to edit files, but also to view certain directories on the system. ![Image related to visible directories]

After several attempts, I blocked a request using Burp Suite and made a change and was able to gain access to the /etc/passwd file. ![Image related to the modification using Burp Suite and the /etc/passwd file]
