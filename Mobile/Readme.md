# Mobile pentesting 
is a computer security practice aimed at identifying and analysing vulnerabilities in mobile applications and the devices on which they run.
Mobile pentesting includes several steps, such as analysing the source code (if available), inspecting the communication between the app and the servers (APIs), analysing local data storage, and studying the authorisations and functionality of the app. During testing, specific tools for **iOS** and **Android** platforms are used, and methodologies such as OWASP's **Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)** are adopted to ensure a thorough analysis that complies with security standards.


In the course of this project, I will attempt to explain on a theoretical and practical level some of the fundamental techniques of mobile security and introduce key tools such as SSL Pinning, Frida, Objection, and MobSF.
