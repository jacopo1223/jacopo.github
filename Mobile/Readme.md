# Mobile pentesting (penetration testing on mobile devices) 
is a computer security practice aimed at identifying and analysing vulnerabilities in mobile applications and the devices on which they run.

Mobile pentesting includes several steps, such as analysing the source code (if available), inspecting the communication between the app and the servers (APIs), analysing local data storage, and studying the authorisations and functionality of the app. During testing, specific tools for **iOS** and **Android** platforms are used, and methodologies such as OWASP's **Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)** are adopted to ensure a thorough analysis that complies with security standards.
